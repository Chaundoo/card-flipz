## Where the cards are saved
Cards are split into one file per era, so no single file gets near GitHub's 25 MB upload limit:

```
eras/eras.json            list of eras (and set-name patterns used to guess a new set's era)
eras/wotc/wotc.json       Wizards of the Coast (1999–2003)
eras/ex/ex.json           EX (2003–2007)
eras/dp-hgss/dp-hgss.json Diamond & Pearl / HeartGold SoulSilver (2007–2011)
eras/bw/bw.json           Black & White (2011–2013)
eras/xy/xy.json           XY (2014–2016)
eras/sm/sm.json           Sun & Moon (2017–2019)
eras/swsh/swsh.json       Sword & Shield (2020–2023)
eras/sv/sv.json           Scarlet & Violet (2023–2025)
eras/me/me.json           Mega Evolution (2025–)
eras/other/other.json     other promos & products
pairings.json             saved pairings
```

## Saving edits from the site
When you save a card, the site downloads only the era file(s) that changed (e.g. `sv.json`).
Upload each one into its own folder: **eras → sv → Add file → Upload files**.
Pairings download as `pairings.json` and go in the main folder.

## Adding a new era later
Add an entry to `eras/eras.json` above `"other"` (id, name, years, set-name patterns), then create
`eras/<id>/<id>.json` containing `{"era":"<id>","version":"0","cards":[]}`.

## Weekly price refresh
`.github/workflows/price-refresh.yml` runs `scripts/refresh_prices.py` every Friday. It reads every
era file, refreshes raw prices, and only rewrites the era files that changed.
